## Usage
Run the script MLRepurposingInitialScreen.py to train the random forest model to distinguish between the control strains and then perform the inference on the wells with the worms treated with the different compounds.
```bash
python MLRepurposingInitialScreen.py
```

Run the script plot_top_compounds_CI_lower_InitialScreen.py to obtain the ranking of the compounds and generate the paper figures.
```bash
python plot_top_compounds_CI_lower_InitialScreen.py
```
